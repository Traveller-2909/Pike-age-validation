Data and code used in Rittweg et al."Corroborating otolith age using oxygen isotopes and comparing outcomes to scale age: Consequences for estimation of growth and 
reference points in northern pike (Esox lucius)" (DOI: 10.1111/fme.12646). Please note that the MCMC outputs are not uploaded because the files are too large. 
To run scripts that depend on those, run the respective chunks with R and Stan, which will generate the files in the correct folder.
